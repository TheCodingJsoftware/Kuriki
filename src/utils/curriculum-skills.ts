    "Communication": [
        "Students are expected to use communication in order to learn and express their understanding.",
        "Students need opportunities to read about, represent, view, write about, listen to, and discuss mathematical ideas. These opportunities allow students to create links among their own language and ideas, the language and ideas of others, and the formal language and symbols of mathematics.",
        "Communication is important in clarifying, reinforcing, and modifying ideas, attitudes, and beliefs about mathematics. Students should be encouraged to use a variety of forms of communication while learning mathematics. Students also need to communicate their learning using mathematical terminology.",
        "Communication can play a significant role in helping students make connections among concrete, pictorial, graphical, symbolic, verbal, written, and mental representations of mathematical ideas. Explanation of ideas should use the various representations as appropriate.",
        "Emerging technologies enable students to engage in communication beyond the traditional classroom to gather data and share mathematical ideas."
    ],

    "Connection": [
        "Students are expected to make connections among mathematical ideas, other concepts in mathematics, everyday experiences, and other disciplines.",
        "Contextualization and making connections to the experiences of learners are powerful processes in developing mathematical understanding. When mathematical ideas are connected to each other or to real- world phenomena, students begin to view mathematics as useful, relevant, and integrated.",
        "Learning mathematics within contexts and making connections relevant to learners can validate past experiences and increase student willingness to participate and be actively engaged.",
        "The brain is constantly looking for and making connections. “Because the learner is constantly searching for connections on many levels, educators need to orchestrate the experiences from which learners extract understanding…Brain research establishes and confirms that multiple complex and concrete experiences are essential for meaningful learning and teaching” (Caine and Caine 5)."

    "Mental Mathematics and Estimation": [
        "Students are expected to demonstrate fluency with mental mathematics and estimation.",
        "Mental mathematics and estimation is a combination of cognitive strategies that enhance flexible thinking and number sense. It involves using strategies to perform mental calculations.",
        "Mental mathematics enables students to determine answers without paper and pencil. It improves computational fluency by developing efficiency, accuracy, and flexibility in reasoning and calculating.",
        "“Even more important than performing computational procedures or using calculators is the greater facility that students need-more than ever before- with estimation and mental math” (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, May 2005).",
        "Students proficient with mental mathematics “become liberated from calculator dependence, build confidence in doing mathematics, become more flexible thinkers and are more able to use multiple approaches to problem solving” (Rubenstein 442).",
        "Mental mathematics “provides a cornerstone for all estimation processes, offering a variety of alternative algorithms and nonstandard techniques for finding answers” (Hope v).",
        "Estimation is used for determining approximate values or quantities, usually by referring to benchmarks or referents, or for determining the reasonableness of calculated values. Estimation is also used to make mathematical judgments and to develop useful, efficient strategies for dealing with situations in daily life. When estimating, students need to learn which strategy to use and how to use it.",
        "To help students become efficient with computational fluency, students need to develop mental math skills and recall math facts automatically. Learning math facts is a developmental process where the focus of instruction is on thinking and building number relationships. Facts become automatic for students through repeated exposure and practice. When a student recalls facts, the answer should be produced without resorting to inefficient means, such as counting. When facts are automatic, students are no longer using strategies to retrieve them from memory."
    ],

    "Problem Solving": [
        "Students are expected to develop and apply new mathematical knowledge through problem solving.",
        "”Problem solving is an integral part of all mathematics learning” (NCTM, Problem Solving). Learning through problem solving should be the focus of mathematics at all grade levels. Students develop a true understanding of mathematical concepts and procedures when they solve problems in meaningful contexts. Problem solving is to be employed throughout all of mathematics and should be embedded throughout all the topics.",
        "When students encounter new situations and respond to questions of the type, How would you...? or How could you..?, the problem-solving approach is being modelled. Students develop their own problem-solving strategies by listening to, discussing, and trying different strategies.",
        "In order for an activity to be based on problem solving, it must ask students to determine a way to get from what is known to what is sought. If students have already been given ways to solve the problem, it is not a problem, but practice. Students should not know the answer immediately. A true problem requires students to use prior knowledge in new ways and contexts. Problem solving requires and builds depth of conceptual understanding and student engagement. Students will be engaged if the problems relate to their lives, cultures, interests, families, or current events.",
        "Both conceptual understanding and student engagement are fundamental in moulding students’ willingness to persevere in future problem-solving tasks.",
        "Problems are not just simple computations embedded in a story, nor are they contrived. They are tasks that are rich and open-ended, so there may be more than one way of arriving at a solution or there may be multiple answers. Good problems should allow for every student in the class to demonstrate their knowledge, skill, or understanding. Problem solving can vary from being an individual activity to a class (or beyond) undertaking.",
        "In a mathematics class, there are two distinct types of problem solving: solving contextual problems outside of mathematics and solving mathematical problems. Finding the maximum profit given manufacturing constraints is an example of a contextual problem, while seeking and developing a general formula to solve a quadratic equation is an example of a mathematical problem.",
        "Problem solving can also be considered in terms of engaging students in both inductive and deductive reasoning strategies. As students make sense of the problem, they will be creating conjectures and looking for patterns that they may be able to generalize. This part of the problem-solving process often involves inductive reasoning. As students use approaches to solving the problem they often move into mathematical reasoning that is deductive in nature. It is crucial that students be encouraged to engage in both types of reasoning and be given the opportunity to consider the approaches and strategies used by others in solving similar problems.",
        "Problem solving is a powerful teaching tool that fosters multiple creative and innovative solutions. Creating an environment where students openly look for, and engage in, finding a variety of strategies for solving problems empowers students to explore alternatives and develops confident, cognitive mathematical risk-takers."
    ],

    "Reasoning": [
        "Students are expected to develop mathematical reasoning.",
        "Mathematical reasoning helps students think logically and make sense of mathematics. Students need to develop confidence in their abilities to reason and justify their mathematical thinking. Questions that challenge students to think, analyze, and synthesize help them develop an understanding of mathematics. All students need to be challenged to answer questions such as “Why do you believe that’s true/correct?” or “What would happen if…?”.",
        "Mathematical experiences provide opportunities for students to engage in inductive and deductive reasoning. Students use inductive reasoning when they explore and record results, analyze observations, make generalizations from patterns, and test these generalizations. Students use deductive reasoning when they reach new conclusions based upon the application of what is already known or assumed to be true. The thinking skills developed by focusing on reasoning can be used in daily life in a wide variety of contexts and disciplines.",
        "When explaining ideas, students should be encouraged to use concrete, pictorial, symbolic, graphical, verbal, and written representations of their mathematical ideas."
    ],

    "Technology": [
        "Students are expected to select and use technology as a tool for learning and solving problems.",
        "Technology can be used effectively to contribute to and support the learning of a wide range of mathematical learning outcomes. Technology enables students to explore and create patterns, examine relationships, test conjectures, and solve problems. Students in Grades 9 to 12 are expected to have consistent access to technology for their mathematics courses.",
        "Technology has the potential to enhance the teaching and learning of mathematics. It can be used to",
        "explore and demonstrate mathematical relationships and patterns",
        "organize and display data",
        "generate and test inductive conjectures",
        "extrapolate and interpolate",
        "assist with calculation procedures as part of solving problems",
        "increase the focus on conceptual understanding by decreasing the time spent on repetitive procedures",
        "reinforce the learning of basic facts",
        "develop personal procedures for mathematical operations",
        "model situations",
        "develop number and spatial sense",
        "create geometric figures",
        "Technology contributes to a learning environment in which the curiosity of students can lead to rich mathematical discoveries at all grade levels.",
        "Students need to know when it is appropriate to use technology such as a calculator and when to apply their mental computation, reasoning, and estimation skills to predict and check answers. The use of technology can enhance, although it should not replace, conceptual understanding, procedural thinking, and problem solving."
    ],

    "Visualization": [
        "Students are expected to develop visualization skills to assist in processing information, making connections, and solving problems.",
        "Visualization “involves thinking in pictures and images, and the ability to perceive, transform and recreate different aspects of the visual-spatial world” (Armstrong 10). The use of visualization in the study of mathematics provides students with opportunities to understand mathematical concepts and make connections among them.",
        "Visual images and visual reasoning are important components of number, spatial, and measurement sense. Number visualization occurs when students create mental representations of numbers.",
        "Being able to create, interpret, and describe a visual representation is part of spatial sense and spatial reasoning. Spatial visualization and spatial reasoning enable students to describe the relationships among and between 3-D objects and 2-D shapes.",
        "Measurement visualization goes beyond the acquisition of specific measurement skills. Measurement sense includes the ability to determine when to measure and when to estimate and involves knowledge of several estimation strategies (Shaw and Cliatt 150).",
        "Visualization is fostered through the use of concrete materials, technology, and a variety of visual representations. It is through visualization that abstract concepts can be understood concretely by the student.",
        "Visualization is a foundation to the development of abstract understanding, confidence, and fluency."
