                    <p></p>
                    Reflecting on my own critical thinking:
                    <ul>
                        <li>What does it mean to think critically? Why is it important?</li>
                        <li>How do I decide whether something I read or watch is true or not? What strategies do I use as an adult learner? What strategies do I model and encourage for the learners?</li>
                        <li>How do I make reasoned judgments and sound decisions as an adult learner?</li>
                        <li>What are my own strengths and stretches as a critical thinker?</li>
                    </ul>
                    Reflecting on my classroom practice: How do I explain critical thinking to the learners?
                    <ul>
                        <li>What opportunities could I create for learners to think critically and make reasoned judgments?</li>
                        <li>How do I explicitly teach learners to evaluate sources for bias, reliability, and relevance?</li>
                        <li>How do I design learning experiences that purposely encourage learners to reconsider their thinking?</li>
                        <li>How do I support learners in understanding why perspectives might be different in different contexts?</li>

                    <h5>Common Misconceptions and Partial Understandings</h5>
                    <p><em>Critical thinking encourages learners to critize ideas or others. It teachers learners ot be disparaging or judgemental. (Gini-Newman and Case)</em></p>
                    <p>Critical thinking is not about criticism or being disparaging to others; instead, it is "criterial thinking" (i.e., focused thinking while keeping in mind specific criteria). Critical thinking involves making a reasoned judgment while
                        considering relevant criteria, such as what would be reasonable or sensible to believe or do.</p>
                    <p><em>Critical thinking equates to cynicism. It encourages learners to doubt or discount everything they read or hear. (Gini-Newman and Case)</em></p>
                    <p>Critical thinking is focused on making thoughtful decisions and reasoned judgments based on criteria. Rather than learners being cynical or discounting everything they read or hear, they are instead encouraged to be respectful, informed
                        thinkers with ongoing attitudes of self-reflection.</p>
                    <p><em>Critical thinking is largerly focused on logic and argumentation. (Gini-Newman and Case)</em></p>
                    <p>Fully understood, thinking critically is usefully and creatively applied to any task we may want to undertake, ranging from engaging with daily news to making a decision about what course to take or how to solve a problem with a friend.
                        Critical thinking is something we need to address and support learners within and across ALL disciplines and courses.</p>
                    <p><em>Young learners cannot think critically or even be taught to think critically.</em></p>
                    <p>Children can begin to think critically from early childhood. In fact, research suggests that "there are kernels of critical thinking and rational thinking even in infancy" (Golinkoff & Hirsh-Pasek 162). The Delphi Report, a prolific
                        study, focused on the topic of critical thinking in schools. It suggests "from early childhood, people should be taught...to reason, to see relevant facts, to consider options, and to understand the views of others" (Facione 27).
                        Critical thinking is important to model and explore in intentional ways, starting with the earliest learners.</p>

                    <h5>Common Misconceptions and Partial Understandings</h5>
                    <p><em>Creativity is about artistic expression.</em></p>
                    <p>Creativity is not reserved for sculptors, poets, musicians, or painters, etc., and artistic expression. Creativity transcends all professions, disciplines, and facets of daily life. Creativity ultimately involves "purposeful creation
                        that is novel or unique and has value or significance" (Gini-Newman and Case 51).</p>
                    <p><em>Only a small segment of the population is creative (big C versus little c).</em></p>
                    <p>There is no such thing as a "creative type." We are all born with curiosity and the potential for creative thinking. A small percentage of people might be considered "big C" creative. These people may be famous inventors, Nobel Peace
                        Prize winners, or have work on display in museums. Our focus needs to be on "little c" creativity which relates to when people come up with an idea that is new and useful to them in their daily life, like creating a schedule for
                        a busy family, finding a new way to address a classroom school supply issue, solving a math problem differently, or finding an inventive way to share learning.</p>
                    <p><em>Creativity comes in a flash of insight.</em></p>
                    <p>"Creative intelligence is about tools, not lightbulbs. It's something we do, not something that happens to us. It's about what happens during those moments of insight, but also after; it's the hard work and the collaborations that
                        can help bring your idea out of your mind and into the world" (Nussbaum).</p>
                    <p><em>You can't teach creativity.</em></p>
                    <p>Part of our role as teachers is to nurture, model, encourage, and support creativity. We can do that by creating a learning environment and interactive, organic learning opportunities in which creativity flourishes.</p>

                    <h5>Common Misconceptions and Partial Understandings</h5>
                    <p><em>Citizenship can be described primarily as teaching civics education and helping learners to become "personally responsible citizens" (Westheimer).</em></p>
                    <p>The word citizenship is used differently, depending on the context. As an educational concept, it has a different meaning depending on the jurisdiction in which it is used. Manitoba's definition of the competency of citizenship goes
                        beyond civics education and provides opportunities for learners to
                        <ul>
                            <li>explore a variety of topics and issues</li>
                            <li>foster consideration of diverse perspectives to interact effectively with others</li>
                            <li>take action for the well-being of self, others, and the natural world</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p><em>Large school events such as "culture days" are a sufficient way to learn about diverse cultures and perspectives.</em></p>
                    <p>Large-scale events such as "culture days" or school-wide awareness or fundraising campaigns have value but are not the only way learners practise citizenship. Everyday acts of citizenship impact school communities in important ways.
                        Learning about diverse cultures, viewpoints, and experiences while exploring complex issues in the local and wider community can occur regularly. Practising empathy, embracing inclusive practices, and supporting equity as crucial
                        concepts for decision-making help to improve communities every day.</p>
                    <p><em>Citizenship practices belong primarily in humanities courses.</em></p>
                    <p>Citizenship as a concept might have more regular applications in a social studies course, but learners can be practising the core elements of citizenship in all courses, such as evaluating different factors that lead to decision-making,
                        looking at multiple viewpoints, and finding solutions for the betterment of the world.</p>
                    <p><em>Taking action can be reserved for school-wide initiatives or charity events.</em></p>
                    <p>Learners need daily opportunities to take action, such as finding ways to organize classrooms more inclusively, promoting peer-to-peer conflict management, or finding more efficient recycling or composting methods. These daily opportunities
                        will empower learners to see they can make a difference in their day-to-day lives.</p>

                    <h5>Common Misconceptions and Partial Understandings</h5>
                    <p><em>Connection to self is mainly about understanding personal strengths and passions, and about having agency.</em></p>
                    <p>The competency "connection to self" has a unique definition in the Manitoba context. While it includes elements of identity, it goes beyond simply knowing one's strengths and interests towards knowing the four questions: Who am I?
                        Where do I come from? Where am I going? What is my purpose? (Sinclair) Supporting the development of learners' connection to self encourages them to know themselves, their world views, their histories, and their ever-evolving identity.
                        It also helps learners to determine how they learn best and develops their metacognition, reflection, self-regulation, and agency.</p>
                    <p><em>The teacher's job is to share their knowledge and expertise with learners.</em></p>
                    <p>The traditional role of the teacher has shifted from imparting knowledge to modelling and guiding learners to inquire, experiment, solve problems, and think deeply. In doing so, the teacher empowers learners to take an active role
                        in their learning. The teacher as mentor/coach focuses on teaching learners how to think, not what to think. This practice supports productive struggle, helping learners to grapple with uncertainty and build resiliency.</p>
                    <p><em>Good teaching helps learners learn new concepts easily without making mistakes.</em></p>
                    <p>Making mistakes is one of the most powerful forms of learning. Allowing learners to learn from mistakes, without penalty, focuses learning on growth. Teaching learners how to reflect deepens learning-helping them gain insight into
                        themselves, and supporting student understanding, engagement, and inclusion. Research shows that self-reflection and goal setting can play a significant role in helping learners learn and grow.</p>
                    <p><em>Learners don't need to know about themselves or who they are to learn my subject.</em></p>
                    <p>Learning doesn't happen in a vacuum, and learners can't become autonomous without truly knowing themselves. They need an understanding of who they are and how they have come to see the world, how they learn best, what their strengths
                        and challenges are, and what strategies assist them in becoming lifelong learners.</p>

                    <h5>Common Misconceptions and Partial Understandings</h5>
                    <p><em>Collaboration, cooperation, cooperative learning, collaborative thinking, and teamwork are the same idea.</em></p>
                    <p>Manitoba's definition of collaboration incorporates all of these elements (i.e., cooperation, cooperative learning, and collaborative thinking) so that learners are learning collaboratively "with and from others with a shared commitment
                        for a common purpose and goal."</p>
                    <p><em>There are a number of terms associated with collaboration in the educational context that have different meanings.</em></p>
                    <p>Cooperation is working together to achieve a common goal. We sometimes refer to this as teamwork. Cooperative learning involves having learners work in groups, often with roles assigned (such as notetakers, reporters, etc.) as they
                        work on a shared task or product. The ideas in learners' work might be complementary, but the learners do not necessarily have to "think together." They may complete their roles effectively without entering into quality collaboration.
                        Collaborative thinking involves "deeply engaging with and building on the ideas of others for mutual benefit" (Gini-Newman and Case 55).</p>
                    <p><em>If I put learners into groups to work, they will learn to collaborate.</em></p>
                    <p>Learners will not learn how to work collaboratively through osmosis. They need explicit teaching and modelling on how to, for example, invite diverse voices to conversations, resolve conflicts respectfully, and think through different
                        perspectives. Teachers need to be careful not to make assumptions that learners-particularly in the higher grades-know how to collaborate effectively.</p>
                    <p><em>The purpose of collaboration is to learn content; I do not need to teach it.</em></p>
                    <p>Most teachers use collaboration for this purpose and for good reason. Collaboration supports content learning and engagement. Learners also need strong collaboration skills for multiple purposes. If they never learn HOW to collaborate
                        and collaborate well, they will not learn the content well either.</p>
                    <p><em>If learners confer with each other, they are collaborating.</em></p>
                    <p>Collaboration is not simply conferring with others. In discussion, learners may offer their opinions without seriously thinking about what others are saying. Collaborative thinking involves active listening, weighing, and building
                        on each other's ideas.</p>

                    <h5>Common Misconceptions and Partial Understandings</h5>
                    <p><em>Communication is solely the transmission of a message.</em></p>
                    <p>Communication involves two directions. It does not end with the transmission or expression of a message. It also requires and includes the perspective of the receiver in the context in which they interpret and make sense of the communication.</p>
                    <p><em>To support strong communicators, we need to mainly focus on speaking and writing.</em></p>
                    <p>Communication is dynamic, ever-changing, and complex. It involves engaging in dialogue and conversations, as well as expressing oneself in a variety of contexts. It is about creating messages and sharing ideas for a variety of purposes
                        using many different forms or modalities. It also involves receiving complex messages as one reads, views, listens, and interprets both verbal and non-verbal communications.</p>
                    <p><em>Teaching communication is the English teacher's job.</em></p>
                    <p>Communication drives so much of what we do and how we learn, both in and out of school. It is something we need to address and support within and across ALL disciplines and courses.</p>
                    <p><em>Meaning is derived only from the content of a message.</em></p>
                    <p>In human interaction, non-verbal cues, such as body language, eye contact, tone of voice, gestures, and facial expressions, all play a significant role and influence our understanding alongside the content of the message. In other
                        forms of communication, influences such as text features, design choices, emojis, and many other elements all impact understanding and the meaning we derive, in addition to the content.</p>
