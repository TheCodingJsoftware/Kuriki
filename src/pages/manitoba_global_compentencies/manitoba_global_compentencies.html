                    <h5>Critical Thinking</h5>
                    <p>Critical thinking involves the intentional process of synthesizing and analyzing ideas using criteria and evidence, making reasoned judgments and reflecting on the outcomes and implications of those decisions. The competency of critical
                        thinking facilitates the in-depth examination of situations, questions, problems, opportunities, and perspectives. It encompasses a willingness to challenge assumptions, thoughts, beliefs, and actions. Critical thinking is fundamental
                        to learning more broadly and deeply, and making ethical decisions as reflective and contributing citizens.</p>

                        <li>Encourage learners to question why they may agree or disagree with the opinions of others, and to consider why they may align with or dispute generally accepted views.</li>
                        <li>Make learner thinking visible by introducing learners to a variety of thinking-related vocabulary, strategies, routines, and tools to evaluate evidence and make reasoned judgments, using a critical mindset in all that they encounter
                            and do.</li>
                        <li>Provide learners with open-ended and authentic learning opportunities or "critical challenges" (Gini-Newman and Case), which set the stage for them to determine what is relevant, plan for how they will share their thinking, and

                    Reflecting on my own critical thinking:
                    <ul>
                        <li>What does it mean to think critically? Why is it important?</li>
                        <li>How do I decide whether something I read or watch is true or not? What strategies do I use as an adult learner? What strategies do I model and encourage for the learners?</li>
                        <li>How do I make reasoned judgments and sound decisions as an adult learner?</li>
                        <li>What are my own strengths and stretches as a critical thinker?</li>
                    </ul>
                    Reflecting on my classroom practice: How do I explain critical thinking to the learners?
                    <ul>
                        <li>What opportunities could I create for learners to think critically and make reasoned judgments?</li>

                        <li>How do I design learning experiences that purposely encourage learners to reconsider their thinking?</li>
                        <li>How do I support learners in understanding why perspectives might be different in different contexts?</li>

                    <h5>Common Misconceptions and Partial Understandings</h5>
                    <p><em>Critical thinking encourages learners to critize ideas or others. It teachers learners ot be disparaging or judgemental. (Gini-Newman and Case)</em></p>
                    <p>Critical thinking is not about criticism or being disparaging to others; instead, it is "criterial thinking" (i.e., focused thinking while keeping in mind specific criteria). Critical thinking involves making a reasoned judgment while
                        considering relevant criteria, such as what would be reasonable or sensible to believe or do.</p>
                    <p><em>Critical thinking equates to cynicism. It encourages learners to doubt or discount everything they read or hear. (Gini-Newman and Case)</em></p>
                    <p>Critical thinking is focused on making thoughtful decisions and reasoned judgments based on criteria. Rather than learners being cynical or discounting everything they read or hear, they are instead encouraged to be respectful, informed
                        thinkers with ongoing attitudes of self-reflection.</p>
                    <p><em>Critical thinking is largerly focused on logic and argumentation. (Gini-Newman and Case)</em></p>
                    <p>Fully understood, thinking critically is usefully and creatively applied to any task we may want to undertake, ranging from engaging with daily news to making a decision about what course to take or how to solve a problem with a friend.
                        Critical thinking is something we need to address and support learners within and across ALL disciplines and courses.</p>
                    <p><em>Young learners cannot think critically or even be taught to think critically.</em></p>
                    <p>Children can begin to think critically from early childhood. In fact, research suggests that "there are kernels of critical thinking and rational thinking even in infancy" (Golinkoff & Hirsh-Pasek 162). The Delphi Report, a prolific
                        study, focused on the topic of critical thinking in schools. It suggests "from early childhood, people should be taught…to reason, to see relevant facts, to consider options, and to understand the views of others" (Facione 27).
                        Critical thinking is important to model and explore in intentional ways, starting with the earliest learners.</p>
